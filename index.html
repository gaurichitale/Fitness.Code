	<p><strong><em>About ME</em></strong></p>
	<p><em>Dated:Timeless</em></p>



	<p>Hi! My name is Gauri Chitale. i thought i should share my fitness story with you briefly so you know where i am coming from!</p>

	<p>So my journey hadnt even begun until i was 30 yrs old. Until that point i used to be that lazy chick who would run away from anything fitnessy. Talk about sweat and i would run the other way ( i mean turn the other way. i would never run LOL).When i was growing up i would bunk all PT sessions. i hated those.</p>

	<p>So what changed?</p>

	<p>i gave birth to my adorable and super intelligent son! I gained a LOT of weight during my pregnancy and here i delivered my baby !!!i thought ok this feels good ..the baby is out so how come the extra weight still on me ???
    This got me so confused. I never paid any attention to chatter around me about how women gain weight progressively and how it is more and more difficult to lose all this weight as you age blah blah blah. 
    But hey here i was stuck with all this weight which wont go away! </p>

	<p>AND this is how it all started ---- 
	i decided to lose all the extra weight and Voila i did it! 
	Error ...Lol life doesnt happen like this !!</p>

	<p>From walking on a treadmill at a local gym ( holding the railing cz i was so scared to fall ) to running <a href="https://www.active.com/running/articles/how-many-miles-is-a-5k-and-other-fun-5k-facts" target="_blank">5ks</a>,10ks,half marathons and 2 full <a href="https://www.iffleyroad.com/blogs/journal/26-fun-facts-about-marathons" target="_blank">marathons</a>.From doing bodybuilding workouts and seeing those six pack abs to powerlifiting training and becoming a Certified Personal Trainer !</p>

	<p>All this DIDNOT happen in one year or progressively. There were many valleys and peaks, falls,hurt and sweat. Ridicule and hate were all showered on me consistently, sometimes even those who were closest to me and also by those who didnot even know me! Doubt was cast many times and most people thought i would just give it up after few months or max one year.</p>

	<p>What kept me going ?? 
	This burning desire to FIX what had gone out of control - My weight!
	i started my fitness journey just to lose weight. But once i began,stuff happened, the experiences taught me each time something new that i had to learn and my goals kept changing for better and better.</p><br>

	<p><strong>Coaching</strong></p>
	If you are still here .. ....i am deeply touched by your patience and kindness !! It also tells me you could relate to me somewhere. Our circumstances or situations may not be exactly the same but you could still draw strings from my story which overlap yours ..maybe ?<br>

	Great ..

	<p>Now the good stuff - I am now willing to share all that I have learnt all these years and what I have been learning now with you ALL !
	I offer one on one coaching at my Atlanta based studio & also remote coaching via skype or zoom. I also provide training programs which you can follow along at your own convinience.More on this once we talk !</p>

	<p>If you are new to this journey or somewhere in the middle and need help, take a minute and fill out this form and reach out to me to schedule an appointment. I will be thrilled to help you get started on this path and make you fall in love with this amazing journey.</p>
